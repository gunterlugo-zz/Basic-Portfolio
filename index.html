	<p>I first wanted to be a doctor but then I had the opportunity to work for a healthcare tech start up in San Francisco. I was still doing pre-med at San Francisco State University and I found myself not loving as much as I used to but I was still intrigued with the healthcare industry. I had the opportunity to work with engineers, designers, and other profesionals in the tech industry. What I learned was that there are so many other ways to help people in this world besides being a doctor. That is when I decided I want a career and life in healthcare tech.</p>
